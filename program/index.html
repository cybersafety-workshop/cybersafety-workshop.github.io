							<b>Title: Computational Methods to Understand and Mitigate Online Hate</b>
						</p>

						<p name="keynote_gianluca_abstract" id="keynote_gianluca_abstract">
							 <b>Abstract</b>:Online hate on social media is becoming a serious problem. Aggression is often not the act of single individuals,
							 but rather the result of coordinated activity between like minded people who gather on polarized online communities, identify suitable
							 targets, and carry out their attacks.  Studying this phenomenon is hard, in part because it is not a purely technical problem, in part
							 because this malicious activity unfolds across multiple online services, and the research community currently lacks effective tools to keep
							 track of information that is not contained to a single platform. In this talk, I will present our research on studying the modus operandi of
							 attackers that orchestrate and execute coordinated hate attacks on social media, which we call "raids." I will show that online polarized
							 communities such as 4chan's politically incorrect board are particularly effective in performing this type of attack, often causing great
							 psychological harm to their victims, and that it is possible to identify raids by looking at coordinated activity happening on different
							 platforms (e.g., a thread on 4chan and the comments on a YouTube video). Finally, I will discuss potential countermeasures against this
							 phenomenon. <a href="../ppts/cybersafety-Stringhini.pdf">(Slides Can be found here)</a>

							<b>Title: Statistical Mechanics of Sh*tposting</b>
						</p>

						<p name="keynote_barry_abstract" id="keynote_barry_abstract">
							 <b>Abstract</b>: With the rise of social media, the speed and scale of information propagation have risen to unprecedented levels.
							 Along with all its positive societal effects, this communication revolution has also unfortunately created platforms for extremists to
							 congregate, recruit, and plan. Understanding the formation and growth of these extremist networks, as well as decoding the meaning of
							 their slang and visual imagery, is of utmost priority. In this talk, I outline a transdisciplinary research program to address these issues,
							 combining tools from both computer science and statistical physics. I will review our prior work showing how semantic embeddings and stochastic
							  process modeling can be used to track the meaning and influence of memes across different social networks. I will then outline our efforts to
								incorporate time-dependence into these models, in order to create a coarse-grained, generative model of information diffusion in extremist networks.

							Data-driven Research for Advanced Modeling and Analysis Lab, and a founding member of the Network Contagion Research Institute. His has worked on
							topics ranging from developing a formalism for computing the viscoelastic and thermal response functions for two dimensional topological phases,
							predicting the existence of topologically charged, multiply degenerate fermions in weakly interacting crystals with no known analogue in high
							energy physics, and developing real-space formulation of topological band theory. More recently, his work with iDRAMA Lab and NCRI has focused on
							developing numerical methods to analyze large-scale, human behavior through the lens of hate speech and racism online.

							<b>Title: Content Security at Reddit</b>
						</p>

						<p name="keynote_tyler_abstract" id="keynote_tyler_abstract">
							 <b>Abstract</b>:Reddit’s moderation and governance model is unique within the internet landscape. In addition to its sitewide policies and
							 enforcement, Reddit has cultivated a community-driven ecosystem that empowers users to work with volunteer community moderators and internal
							 company admins to help curate quality content and reduce the exposure of rule-breaking content and ensure the content is fitting with community
							 standards. Increasingly, Reddit is using data science to aggregate and enrich these signals, allowing us to catch issues that would be more
							 challenging for an individual to notice. This investment in data science has drastically improved the speed and efficacy with which Reddit is
							 able to respond to threats. By better leveraging analytics, Reddit has been able to increase the percentage of content that is taken down
							 proactively from 27% in 2017 to around 99%.

							<b>Bio</b>:Tyler Otto is the Director of Threat Analytics at Reddit. His team leverages data science for the detection and

							Additionally, his team builds models to help improve traditional operations teams be more effective and efficient. Prior to running threat
							analytics at Reddit, Tyler lead the product Data Science team at Reddit. Before Reddit, he was the Head of Data Science at Hipmunk, a
							travel startup that was acquired by Concur.
