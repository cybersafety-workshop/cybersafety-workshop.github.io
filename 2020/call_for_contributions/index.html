							The Web provides a valuable space for individuals to interact with each other, and read, publish and share content.
							Despite these benefits, the proliferation of virality and anonymity in the modern Web has resulted in a breeding ground for
							online misbehavior and compromised cybersafety in varying forms such as fraudulent engagement, misinformation and propaganda,
							user deception and scams, harassment, hate speech, cyberthreats, cyberbullying and more. These issues have severe negative impacts
							in terms of manipulated user perception and increased exposure to harmful and offensive content at best, and social, psychological
							and physical harm at worst. Thus, they unsurprisingly incur large social and financial costs from the perspectives of online social
							platforms who aim to improve user experience and encourage web activity.
						</p>
						<p>
							The study of these topics has become especially crucial in recent years, due to the constant increase in abuse vectors and tactics,
							and has taken a social spotlight due to its widespread ramifications. The CyberSafety 2019 workshop provides an interdisciplinary venue
							for researchers in various computational fields including network science, machine learning, data mining, human-computer interaction,
							natural language processing, web systems, security and privacy and more, to gather and present recent advances in research on online misbehavior.
						</p>

						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Bots, cyborgs, and automated accounts</li>
