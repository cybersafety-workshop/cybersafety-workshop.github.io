						</p>

						<p name="keynote_david_abstract" id="keynote_david_abstract">
							 <b>Abstract</b>:There is a lot of concern about how the news ecosystem affects public opinion, political polarization,
							 and democracy. Most of the research and public debate focuses on overtly fake material, particularly as it is
							 distributed through social media. But, the vast majority of news consumption is actual produced by mainstream
							 media, and the most common mode of consumption is television. Meanwhile, many key demographic groups consume
							 almost no news at all. Concerns about lack of information or misinformation should focus on where people actual consume
							 (or don’t consume) news, and the product they are actually consuming: mainstream media.</a>

						<p name="keynote_golbeck_abstract" id="keynote_golbeck_abstract">
							 <b>Abstract</b>:Bots do not behave naturally. While they can emulate human behavior in some
							 senses, there are others they cannot control. We can detect this in many ways, including in
							 patterns of social interaction. Identifying these atypical patterns is an important and effective
							 component of a cohesive detection strategy. For fake like bots - bots that simply like or share posts
							 without commenting - detection and elimination is especially important because of the effect they can
							 have on the perceived trustworthiness or importance of content.

						<p name="keynote_pihur_abstract" id="keynote_pihur_abstract">
							 <b>Abstract</b>:To understand the prevalence of something, one does not need to
							 identify every element individually and count them. It is rather impossible to do
							 so in most cases. Often, it is much easier to perform this estimation "anonymously",
							 meaning we can estimate the size or cardinality of a set, without knowing what is exactly
							 in it. There are several major techniques and approaches that are based on statistical estimation
							 and sampling theory that allow for this indirect measurement. We will be taking one of these
							 approaches in this work to understand the prevalence of offensive interactions on Snapchat,
							 as well as their reach, in terms of how many users they have affected.

							<b>Title: Temporal Interaction EmbeddingS (TIES): Incorporating context for finding abuse at scale</b>
						</p>

						<p name="keynote_aude_abstract" id="keynote_aude_abstract">
							 <b>Abstract</b>:Machine learning models for detecting integrity issues have made significant
							 progress thanks to research in natural language processing or computer vision. However,
							 using content alone may not always be sufficient (or even available) for accurate predictions,
							 and these algorithms still need to be complemented by hundreds of hand-engineered features aiming
							 to capture user behavior. Producing these features is laborious, requires deep domain expertise, and
							 may not capture all of the most important information about the entity being classified. In this talk
							 we present an alternative approach: instead of relying on content alone or hand-crafting features,
							 we distill the entire sequence of interactions involving the entity into a low-dimensional feature
							 vector (or “embedding”) that can be input into a classifier for any prediction task. Our algorithm,
							 TIES (Temporal Interaction EmbeddingS), is a supervised deep learning model that captures static
							 features around each interaction source and target, as well as temporal features of the interaction sequence.

							 In our implementation at Facebook, we found that TIES significantly improves existing classifiers for several
							 prediction tasks involving an entity interacting with other objects online, and that our approach is
							 particularly valuable in situations where context is essential to prediction (e.g. hate speech). We also
							 expect TIES to provide additional value when content is not available (e.g., encrypted messaging), or when
							 we want to make predictions before the harm is done (e.g., while a bad actor is searching for victims).
